VTA Java Assignment

1.Write a java program which displays a different message depending on the age 
given. Here are the possible responses:
 Age is less than 16 should display “You cannot drive.”’
 Age is less than 18 should display “You cannot vote.”
 Age is less than 25 should display “You cannot rent a House.”
 Age is 25 or over should display “You can do anything that is legal.”
Notice that a person who is under 16 should get three messages.

2.Write a java program to pick a random number from 1 to 10 and have the user try to guess 
that number. Display them if they get it right or wrong, and if they get it wrong show them 
what the random number was. Note they will only get one try.

3.Write a java program to perform a mathematical calculation between two numbers 
entered by the user. Whenever you run the program main method should display an output 
(main menu) as given below.
Enter
*: For multiplication
/: For division
+: For addition
- : For Subtraction
Any other character: To exit

4.Write a Java program to get the GPA of a student as a command line argument. Then 
display the class of the degree according to the following criteria.
gpa ≥ 3.6 “First Class Hons”
3.6 > gpa ≥ 3.4 “Upper Second Class Hons”
3.4 > gpa ≥ 3.00 “Lower Second Class Hons”
3.00> gpa ≥ 2.00 “Pass”

5. Write an interactive quiz. It should ask the user three multiple choice or true/false 
questions about something. It must keep track of how many they got wrong and print 
out a score at the end (At least implement 3 to 5 static questions).

6. Modify your previous number guessing game (Question 02) so that user can guess until 
they get it right. That means it will keep looping as long as the guess is different from the 
random generated number.

7.Write a java program to take the square root of a number typed in by the user. Your 
program should use a loop to ensure that the number they typed in is positive. If the number 
is negative, you should print out some sort of warning and make them type it again. (Hint : you 
can get the square root of a number n with Math.sqrt(n))

8.Write a java program to generate a list of all the positive two digit numbers. Display the 
numbers, and the sums of their digits.

9.Write a java program that gets three integers from the user. Count from the first number 
to the second number in increments of the third number.

10.Write a java program that gets several integers from the user. Sum up all the integers they 
give. Stop looping when they enter 0. Display the total at the end.
